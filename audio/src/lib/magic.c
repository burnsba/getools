    /**
     * where are you now:
     * 
     * There are three pieces to audio processing: encoding, decoding, resolving codebook.
     * This is the "resolving codebook" piece.
     * 
     * Background:
     * 
     * Predictive Coders are a class of algorithm that estimate future data from previous data.
     * The goal is to minimize the amount of data required to be transmitted, while minimizing
     * signal loss. For the N64, this translates to minimizing the amount of space used on ROM.
     * 
     * I believe the N64 compression algorithm has roots from differential speech processing
     * algorithms (DPCM). Speech audio would be sampled, compared against a previous sample to 
     * generate a predictor, then the predictor error against the model (expected sample) 
     * would be transmitted instead of the audio signal. The receiver would have a
     * predefined model to decode the signal.
     * 
     * The N64 audio algorithm is similar in that the prediction error against the
     * model is what ends up encoded. However, there is no predefined model/codebook.
     * This needs to be generated for each audio file (algorithm below). Industry codecs (e.g., G.728 CELP)
     * calculate / apply codebooks over narrow time slices, but the implementation for
     * N64 uses the same codebook for the entire audio file.
     * 
     * When generating the predictors, a select number are used as feedback into the
     * next audio frame's predictors. The number used as feedback is the "order"
     * (an n'th order predictive coder). 
     * 
     * The "Adaptive" part of Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM)
     * comes from the encode/decode algorith, applying a scale that varies with
     * each audio frame. 
     * 
     * foot note: there are many related kinds of predictive coders: Linear Predictive 
     * Coders (LPC), Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM), Adaptive Differential
     * Pulse Code Modulation (ADPCM), Code Excited Linear Predictor (CELP).
     * 
     * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * 
     * The goal of this algorithm is to create `npredictor` number of predictors that 
     * minimize square error when encoding the file. The predictors are shared by
     * every audio frame (16 samples of 16-bits) in the file.
     * 
     * This is my best understanding of the algorithm:
     * 
     * create a `tally` container of length `order` (one for each npredictor)
     * 
     * Read the sound data 16 bytes at a time (one frame). If there aren't 16 bytes available then we're done.
     * For each frame read
     *     - Compute the auto-correlation vector (B).
     *     - If this is above the threshold, compute the auto-correlation
     *       coefficients for auto-correlation matrix (A).
     *     - Attempt to solve the auto-correlation matrix for transfer function coefficients x in Ax=B.
     * 
     *     - Calculate the kfroma from x. If these have any poles on or outside the unit
     *       circle, discard this frame. If this were an adaptive codebook, error
     *       correction might take place here (e.g, reflect into the unit circle), but
     *       since the codebook will apply to the entire sound it's ok to drop frames
     *       when solving for an efficient codebook.
     * 
     *     - force stability: Clamp kfroma between 1.0 - epsilon and -1.0 + epsilon
     *     - Compute the afromk from kfroma
     *     - compute the rfroma from afromk
     *     - add result to arbitrary tally (this is where it splits into different predictors)
     * 
     * Foreach tally:
     *     - Normalize tally (divide each element by number of elements)
     * 
     *     - Do the durbin on tally to find reflection (aka predictor) coefficients, using last rfroma as model
     *     - force stability: Clamp between 1.0 - epsilon and -1.0 + epsilon
     *     - Compute the afromk.
     *     - Send results to codebook untangler (and add to total results codebook)
